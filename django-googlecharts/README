Google Charts template tag
==========================

This is a suite of template tags to assist in generating charts using Google's
`Chart API`__. There's deliberately no Python-level API; try pygooglechart__
for that.

Currently the library is long on code, and short on testing and documentation.
It's only been tested against Django 1.1 and Python 2.5.

For example usage, see ``docs/examples.html``.
